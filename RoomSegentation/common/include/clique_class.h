// This class is used to easily define cliques from a graph. A Clique is a subgraph of a given graph, in which all Points are
// connected to each other. So this class has a element member_Points that stores all Points that are part of this clique.
// Also it has different functions:
//		1. getMemberPoints(): This function returns a vector<cv::Point> with all members in it.
//		2. insertMember(cv::Point/vector<cv::Point)): This function takes one cv::Point or a vector of them and adds them to
//													  the member Points.
//		3. getNumberOfMembers(): This function returns the number of members in the clique.
//		4. getCliquePotential(vector<unsigned int> labels, vector<cv::CvBoost> boost_classifiers):
//				This function is used for the Voronoi Random Field Segmentation. It gets a list of AdaBoost classifiers
//				( from OpenCV ) and calculates the feature for this clique, depending on the given labels for each Point.
//				The labels show to which class each Point belongs and are describing the position of the AdaBoost classifier
//				in the given vector. It then calculates Phi(y_k, x) = exp(w_k^T * f_k(y_k, x)). Phi is the clique potential
//				needed for the conditional random field, w_k is the weight-vector, defined for each classifier and put together
//				for each point here and f_k is the feature vector, that calculates individual features for each point to label
//				them as a specific class. y_k are the member points of a clique and x is the hidden node of the conditional
//				random field, in this case the given gridmap.
